# Spice.ai v0.6-alpha

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.6-alpha! üèπ

Spice.ai now loads data 10-100x faster! üöÄ It can also scale to datasets 10x larger. We've rebuilt Spice.ai's data processing and transport upon [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), a high-performance platform that uses an in-memory columnar format. Spice.ai joins other major projects including Apache Spark, pandas, and InfluxDB in being powered by Apache Arrow. This also paves the way for high-performance data connections to the Spice.ai runtime using Apache Arrow Flight and import/export of data using [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). We're incredibly excited about the potential this architecture has for building intelligent applications on top of a high-performance transport between application data sources the Spice.ai AI engine.

## Highlights in v0.6-alpha

### Massive improvement in data loading performance and dataset scale

From [data connectors](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataconnectors), to [REST API](https://docs.spiceai.org/api/), to AI engine, we've now rebuilt Spice.ai's data processing and transport on the Apache Arrow project. Specifically, the [Apache Arrow for Go](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/go) implementation, with many thanks to [Matt Topol](https://github.com/zeroshade) for his contributions to the project and guidance on using it.

This includes changing the Spice.ai runtime to AI Engine transport from sending text CSV over gGPC to Apache Arrow Records over IPC (Unix sockets).

This is a breaking change to the [Data Processor interface](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataprocessors#contribution-guide), as it now uses `arrow.Record` instead of `Observation`.

## New in this release

- **Adds** Apache Arrow data processing and transport.
- **Fixes** [TensorBoard logging](https://docs.spiceai.org/training/monitoring/) and monitoring when using GitHub Codespaces and Docker.
- **Adds** Polling [HTTP Data Connector](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/blob/trunk/dataconnectors/http/README.md)

### Dependency updates

- **Updates** to numpy 1.21.0
- **Updates** to marked 3.0.8
- **Updates** to follow-redirects 1.14.7
